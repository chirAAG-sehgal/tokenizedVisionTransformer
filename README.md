# Tokenized Vision Transformer

![Tokenized Vision Transformer](transformer.png)

This project aims to implement a Tokenized Vision Transformer (T-ViT) model for classification tasks. The T-ViT leverages the strengths of transformer architectures to handle image data efficiently by tokenizing the input images. It processes the images in a discretized domain and classifies them.
